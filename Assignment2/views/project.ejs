    <h1>My Projects</h1>
    <p>Here are some of the projects I've worked on that have helped me build and strengthen my skills.</p>

    <article id="projects">
         <!-- Project 1 -->
        <section class="flip-card">
            <div class="flip-card-front">
                <h3>ERP Simulation Game</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="flip-card-back">
                <p>
                    For this project, my team and I participated in a business simulation game where we managed a
                    virtual company's operations. I focused on analyzing sales data and creating visualizations
                    to improve decision-making strategies.

        <!-- Project 2 -->
        <section class="flip-card">
            <div class="flip-card-front">
                <h3>Mac Processor Comparison Presentation</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="flip-card-back">
                <p>
                    As part of a group project, we researched and presented a comparison of Apple Silicon vs
                    Intel processors. I contributed by handling product details such as name, price, and
                    technical specifications.
                </p>

        <!-- Project 3 -->
        <section class="flip-card">
            <div class="flip-card-front">
                <h3>Object-Oriented Programming GUI</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="flip-card-back">
                <p>
                    I created a graphical user interface (GUI) for an object-oriented programming project.
                    The GUI allows users to interact with the program easily, demonstrating concepts
                    like classes, objects, and inheritance in a visual and user-friendly way.
                </p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <!-- Project 4 -->
        <section class="flip-card">
            <div class="flip-card-front">
                <h3>Ecology Report</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="flip-card-back">
                <p>
                    I completed a research paper on species interactions and energy flow in
                    ecosystems. The project helped me strengthen my ability to analyze scientific topics and
                    present findings clearly.

            <div class="flip-card-front">
                <h3>Business Plan Draft</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="flip-card-back">
                <p>
                    I developed a business plan concept for a bakery startup, including product
                    ideas, pricing strategies, and branding inspiration. This project allowed me to explore
                    entrepreneurship in a practical way.
